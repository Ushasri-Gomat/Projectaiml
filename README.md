Multilingual Rumor Detection Using Ensembled Approach** is a deep learning-based NLP project designed to detect and classify rumors across multiple Indian languages, including English, Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, and Marathi. The project addresses the challenge of misinformation spread on social media platforms in a linguistically diverse country like India. It leverages a hybrid ensemble of advanced models—BERT, GRU, and Self-Attention—to improve the accuracy and robustness of rumor detection. The dataset, sourced from publicly available multilingual social media content, is preprocessed using tokenization, cleaning, and vectorization techniques suitable for multilingual BERT (IndoBERT). Each model is trained individually, and their predictions are combined using a majority voting mechanism to form the final ensemble output. The system achieves high accuracy and F1-scores across all languages, outperforming individual models in both binary classification and multilingual consistency. Evaluation metrics include precision, recall, accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC curves. The project is implemented in Python using libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers, NLTK, and Matplotlib. Future improvements include expanding to additional languages, real-time deployment, and creating a user-friendly web application interface for public use.
